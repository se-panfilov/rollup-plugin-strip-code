# rollup-plugin-strip-code

A rollup plugin to remove parts of code based on regular expressions.

Can be used to remove sections of code.

### Why? And what it does?

_Why_: For example you may want to remove code from production builds, but keep it in development and test environments.

Usefull to remove code from production builds that are only needed in development and test environments, or to remove custom internationalized information.
_What it does_: This plugin uses start and end comments to identify the code sections to strip out. For example:


```js
/*START.TESTS_ONLY*/
VueNotifications._private = {} //'_private' object would be exist only during the test time
VueNotifications._private.getVersion = getVersion // And I would be able to test 'getVersion' function (otherwise it won't be accesible because of the closure
/*END.TESTS_ONLY*/
```
(example from [vue-notifications](https://github.com/se-panfilov/vue-notifications) library)

or a bit simpler:

```js
/* test-code */
removeMeInProduction();
/* end-test-code */

doNotRemoveMe();
```

**Attention**: You have to use `/* ... */` for such comments, not just `// ...`

## Getting Started
First, install `rollup-plugin-strip-code` as a development dependency:

```shell
npm i rollup-plugin-strip-code --save-dev
#or
yarn add rollup-plugin-strip-code --dev
```

## Example config

Add to your `rollup.config.js`:

```js
import pkg from './package.json'
import commonjs from 'rollup-plugin-commonjs'
import resolve from 'rollup-plugin-node-resolve'
import babel from 'rollup-plugin-babel'

//here we are
import stripCode from "rollup-plugin-strip-code"

export default [
  {
    input: 'src/main.js',
    output: {
      file: pkg.browser,
      format: 'umd'
    },
    name: pluginName
  },
  {
    input: 'src/main.js',
    external: external,
    output: [
      {file: pkg.main, format: 'umd', name: pluginName}
    ],
    watch: {
      exclude: ['node_modules/**']
    },
    sourcemap: true,
    plugins: [
      resolve(),
      commonjs(),
      babel({
        exclude: 'node_modules/**'
      }),
      stripCode({
        start_comment: 'START.TESTS_ONLY',
        end_comment: 'END.TESTS_ONLY'
      })
    ]
  }
];
```

WOAH-WOAH, what if I want to **remove the comments conditionnaly**?

You may use [rollup-plugin-conditional](https://github.com/AgronKabashi/rollup-plugin-conditional) plugin for that case, for instance:

```js
const isProduction = process.env.buildTarget === "production" //assuming you'd run it with something like "cross-env BABEL_ENV=production && rollup -c"
...
plugins: [
  conditional(isProduction, [
    stripCode({
      start_comment: 'START.TESTS_ONLY',
      end_comment: 'END.TESTS_ONLY'
    })
  ])
]
...
```

### Options

#### options.start_comment
Type: `String`
Default value: `start_comment`

The text inside the opening comment used to identify code to strip.

#### options.end_comment
Type: `String`
Default value: `end_comment`

The text inside the closing comment used to identify code to strip.

#### options.pattern
Type: `RegExp`
Default value: (a generated RegExp matching the start and end comments)

If the default start and end comment matching doesn't work for you needs, you can supply your own RegExp to match against. If the `pattern` option is specified, the `start_comment` and `end_comment` options are ignored.

## Tests

```shell
npm test
```
